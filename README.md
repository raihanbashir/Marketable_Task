# Marketable_Task
For the final task for the selection for the Marketable.in UI/UX Designer internship, we were asked to redesign the landing page of the website. I redesigned the website choosing to follow a semi-minimalist aesthetic with the provided colour pallete to show professionality and approachability. I took inspiration from other e-learning websites such as udemy and edx. The main colors used in the website are #0C2556, #FFE96D and #E9F1F7. I decided to go for a lighter theme, to enhance readability, encourage focus, and provide a sense of tradition, as learning is normally llinked with textbooks and papers, which are printed/published on white paper. If required, I can design a dark mode according to your baselines
